Getting started
===============

.. note::
    If you haven't installed SpotMAX yet, follow these instructions before proceeding 
    :ref:`how-to-install`.

The simplest way to get started is to play around with the graphical user interface (GUI). 
To run the GUI follow these instructions: :ref:`how-to-run-gui`.

In the GUI you can visualize the result of a previous analysis or setup and run a 
new analysis. 

The easiest way to setup the parameters is to interactively test their effect by 
clicking on the compute button beside each "testable" parameter. 

Take some time to read the description of each parameter in this section 
:ref:`params-desc`. 

Once you are happy with the paramters you can either run the analysis locally or 
save the paramters to a configuration file and run the analysis in the command line 
in headless mode (without the GUI). 

.. note:: 
    The analysis always runs in the terminal, so keep an eye on that. 
    In the terminal, you will also be guided into setting up things like adding 
    or ignoring missing parameters and confirming when you are overwriting some 
    existing file (like from a previous run).

We are constantly improving this documentation and we would like to write a FAQ section.
