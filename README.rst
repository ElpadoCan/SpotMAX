=================================

Fluorescence microscopy data analysis in Python
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you need to **analyse fluorescence microscopy data** you are probably in the 
right place.

SpotMAX will help you with these **two tasks**:

1. Detect and quantify **globular-like structures** (a.k.a. "spots")
2. Segment and quantify **fluorescently labelled structures**

SpotMAX excels in particularly challenging situations, such as 
**low signal-to-noise ratio** and **high spot density**.

It supports **2D, 3D, 4D, and 5D data**, i.e., z-stacks, timelapse, and multiple 
fluorescence channels (and combinations thereof).

Installation
------------

SpotMAX is published on `PyPI`_, therefore it can simply be installed with::

    pip install spotmax

Depending on how you plan to use it, you will need additional packages. 
See here for the `installation guide`_
